                <h4>Vivian of Limhamn, Other on June 23, 2015</h4>
                <p>We planned our almost seven weeks travel around Italy, and of course have searched for different periods. We went on chronological and were very aware about all the details. Booking.com's cookies were very aggressive and kept jumping backwards in time so we had to rewrite the desired period. We found a hotel to an acceptable price and reserved it, after checking the info was right. Booking came through successful, ahem it seemed! In reality it had booked one previous period, and we learned about that, when the hotel wrote a mail asking when we'd arrive. I thought it was a little early to ask, more than a month before we should arrive, but I wrote as soon as I had the opportunity (bad internet connection...). Then the hotel wrote that they had charged us a night for no show, because we should have arrived the 16th of June! I then explained what I thought might have happened, since I have no other idea about it, and still it seems they charge me for nothing, even I wrote the correct dates and of course still want to come there with my family. They don't care since it is high season and easy to get customers. I don't believe for a second, booking.com will admit that their cookies are too aggressive and help me get my money back. And aggressive they are, since I visited the site, it keeps popping up with offers for the periods I had searched for (not including the rest of my search criterion, like number of guests), till the periods are past :( Very annoying. I'd really like to hear from others who have won a battle like this or have any ideas.</p>

                <h4>Marilyn of Monroe Township, NJ on June 22, 2015</h4>
                <p>I booked a holiday apartment on the 26th May 2015 in Puerto Pollensa Mallorca overlooking the sea. I received confirmation of the booking and was asked for a deposit by return, which I did. Then 2 weeks later I was told this apartment was no longer available but they could offer me another one which I declined as it was up a side street - no view. They then offered another one which did have a view albeit of a jetty outside the window But in Alcudia which is 3 km from Puerto Pollensa. Never at any time was I given a reason for this cancellation. I contacted them again and said I would find my own accommodation still from the ones they were offering on their site. I booked another of their properties and was delighted that it was near to our original booking. Again I received confirmation and thought that was that. Alas no. I had another e-mail telling me that the previous occupants wished to stay an extra 2 days and I could only have this property for 5 days. In despair I called their telephone number in Seattle and spoke eventually to a supervisor called ** who assured me this should not have happened - but it does - and that she would sort it out. They have now charged me the full amount for a holiday I don't have and I have had to contact my bank to freeze this payment until they can find out why this money was taken. This is the sort of thing that happens "to other people" and I must say that in all my years of booking holidays online it has never happened to me before - A most upsetting state of affairs and a despicable response from this firm.</p>

                <p>Reservation **. We will never deal with this company again. They promise a best price guarantee and 6 days prior to checking in we find the same hotel, same junior suite, same nights at 700 euro cheaper! They said we are unsuccessful in our claim and have yet to hear back from them. Very disappointed in a company I thought was reputable! Something needs to put a stop to it!</p>

                <h4>sourabh of Chicago, IL on June 15, 2015</h4>
                <p>What a misleading and fraud website. I booked a hotel today (15-June-2015) on their website, where it was showing final payment as SGD 661.50. I paid this amount. An hour later I got a call from my bank that there is a transaction of SGD 777. I called up Booking. They told me that taxes are included, but it clearly mentioned there that taxes will be charged by the hotel when I stay there. The website is so misleading that you don't know that taxes are pending as those are mentioned in a consistent small font never added anywhere. Customer care is the worst. Please do not book through Booking.com.</p>
